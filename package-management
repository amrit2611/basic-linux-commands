in ubuntu we have a package manager named 'apt' which is short for - 'advanced package tool'


apt
Shows a list of subcommands

apt-get
Also shows a list of subcommands.
Also a package manager but 'apt' is newer

nano
If the ubuntu image we are running, does not have nano, error.
Else runs nano.
Nano is a basic text editor for linux

apt install nano
Looks for package 'nano' in package database
May throw an error if not able to locate package 'nano'

apt list
Shows all the packages in the package database

apt update
Updates the package database

<ctrl + L>
clear terminal

apt remove nano
Will uninstall the package 'nano'
